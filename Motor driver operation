The L293D is a typical Driver motor IC which control a set of DC motor simultaneously in any direction
It means that you can control two Dc motor with singlle L293D IC
It works on with H bridge arrangement  H-bridge is a circuit which allows the voltage to be flown in either direction. 
like, voltage need to change its direction for being able to rotate the motor in clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
In single L293D chip has two brigde circuit inside IC which can rotate tow dc motor independently.
There are two Enable pins on l293d. Pin 1 and pin 9, for being able to drive the motor, the pin 1 and 9 need to be high. 
if sometimes both pins are low motor working stop immediately
